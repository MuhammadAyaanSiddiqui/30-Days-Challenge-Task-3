# 30-Days-Challenge-Task-3
1) What new improvements were introduced in Gemini 3.0?
   
Gemini 3.0 brings major improvements in reasoning, understanding long context, and handling multiple formats like text, images, video, audio, and code together. It follows instructions more accurately, performs multi-step tasks better, and integrates more smoothly with developer tools. It also has stronger safety controls, better protection against prompt-injection, and improved reliability. Overall, it’s faster, smarter, and more capable than previous versions especially for coding, analysis, and building AI agents.

2) How does Gemini 3.0 improve coding & automation workflows?
Writing better code with stronger logic, fewer mistakes, and clearer structure.

Debugging smarter, finding errors and fixing them more accurately.

Handling bigger projects because it remembers more context at once.

Automating multi-step tasks (like calling APIs, generating files, running tools) much more smoothly.

Working like an AI agent, meaning it can plan steps, use tools, and complete tasks on its own.

3) How does Gemini 3.0 improve multimodal understanding?
   Gemini 3.0 improves multimodal understanding by becoming much stronger at processing and combining text, images, video, audio, and code all at the same time. It can analyze visuals with more accuracy, describe scenes better, understand long videos, follow spoken audio more clearly, and connect information across all formats. It also keeps a much larger context, so it can handle long files or multiple images without forgetting details. Overall, it understands complex real-world situations far better because it can “see + hear + read + reason” together in one model.

4)Name any two developer tools introduced with Gemini 3.0.
1.Gemini CLI: A command-line interface that lets developers access Gemini 3 Pro directly in the terminal — generating code, running shell commands, fixing bugs via natural-language prompts.
2.Google Antigravity: An “agent-first” integrated development environment (IDE) built for Gemini 3 that allows AI agents to operate in editor, terminal and browser, making development more autonomous.
